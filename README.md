# Learning-ROS
Experimenting with ROS2 and learning along the way. 


## In case you do not have ROS2 installed:
To install ROS2 Jazzy :
https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html

To install Gazebo Harmonic (recommended at the time of writing)
https://gazebosim.org/docs/harmonic/install_ubuntu/

For optimised utilization of ROS2, we utilize packages and implement modularity, heres a few commonly used ones :
Give the file 'install_ros2_jazzy.sh' executable permissions with the following command:
    chmod +x install_ros2_jazzy.sh
Run the script with:
    ./install_ros2_jazzy.sh
This script will automatically execute all the installation commands for the ROS Jazzy packages you mentioned and automatically respond with "yes" to any prompts that require confirmation.
