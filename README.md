# Learning-ROS
Experimenting with ROS2 and learning along the way. 


## In case you do not have ROS2 installed:

Give the file 'install_ros2_jazzy.sh' executable permissions with the following command:
    chmod +x install_ros2_jazzy.sh

Run the script with:
    ./install_ros2_jazzy.sh

This script will automatically execute all the installation commands for the ROS Jazzy packages you mentioned and automatically respond with "yes" to any prompts that require confirmation.
